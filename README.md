# Super Mario Bros.
A Game Maker port of the first three levels of the original Super Mario Bros..

## Premise
This was my final project for my 9th grade computer science class.

## Usage
Mario moves left/right with the arrow keys, jumps with the spacebar, and runs with left shift. Many features are missing and collision can be questionable in several instances. Debug options can be accessed with the D key. It's highly recommended to hit F1 to bring up the in-game information.

## Legal
"Super Mario Bros." and all of its respective properties are owned by Nintendo.
